1. **Big Data:**
    
    - Personal computers and wireless communications have led to "big data."
    - Data is structured, not random, e.g., customer behavior.
    - We need "big theory" to extract structure for understanding processes and making predictions.
2. **Why Learn?**
    
    - Machine learning programs optimize performance using past data.
    - Learning is useful where:
        - Human expertise is unavailable (e.g., Mars navigation).
        - Expertise cannot be explained (e.g., speech recognition).
        - Situations change over time or need adaptation (e.g., computer network routing, user biometrics).
3. **Learning Process:**
    
    - Involves building general models from specific examples.
    - Data is abundant; knowledge is scarce.
4. **Data Mining Applications:**
    
    - Retail (e.g., customer behavior, basket analysis).
    - Finance (e.g., fraud detection).
    - Medicine (e.g., diagnosis).
    - Web mining (e.g., search engines).
5. **Types of Learning:**
    - **Associations**:
	    - Basket analysis
    - **Supervised Learning:**
        - Classification (e.g., credit scoring, face/speech recognition).
        - Regression (e.g., price prediction, mobile robot navigation).
    - **Unsupervised Learning:**
        - Clustering (e.g., customer segmentation, image compression).
    - **Reinforcement Learning:**
        - Learning policies with delayed rewards (e.g., game playing, robot navigation).
6. **Related Topics:**
    
    - High-performance computing (e.g., GPUs, parallel processing).
    - Data privacy, security, and model interpretability (e.g., fairness, bias, adversarial examples).

### Applications

- **Supervised Learning:**
    - Predict future outcomes, extract knowledge, compress data, detect outliers.
- **Unsupervised Learning:**
    - Discover patterns, cluster data for applications like bioinformatics (e.g., protein motifs).
- **Reinforcement Learning:**
    - Develop policies from sequences of actions (e.g., maze navigation).
