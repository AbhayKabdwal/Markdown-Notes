### **1. Applications of Machine Learning**

- **Common Uses**:
    - Image Classification
    - Speech Recognition
    - Spam Detection
    - Fraud Detection
    - Natural Language Processing (NLP)
    - Computational Advertising

### **2. Machine Learning and its Impact**

- Machine learning is seen as transformative in various industries, from web rankings to medical diagnosis.
- **Quotes on Machine Learning**:
    - Bill Gates: "A breakthrough in machine learning would be worth ten Microsofts."
    - John Hennessy (Stanford): "Machine learning is the hot new thing."

### **3. Artificial Intelligence Approaches**

- **Knowledge-Based AI**: Relies on encoding knowledge about the world using rules, facts, and expert input.
- **Machine Learning (ML)**: Extracts patterns and predictions from data, rather than using explicit rules.

### **4. Knowledge-Based Systems in AI**

- **Key Components**:
    - **Knowledge Base (KB)**: Stores facts and rules.
    - **Control Strategy**: Determines which rules to apply and navigates the KB.
    - **Inference Engine**: Derives new knowledge from existing data.
- Knowledge is dynamic, incomplete, and requires constant updating.

### **5. Machine Learning Approaches**

- **Model Building**:
    - Map raw data to feature vectors.
    - Choose the model form (e.g., linear regression, neural network).
    - Evaluate the model’s performance on unseen data.
- **Supervised Learning**: Predicts outcomes from known inputs (e.g., classification, regression).
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Discovers patterns without predefined labels (e.g., clustering, anomaly detection).

### **6. Types of Models**

- **Point Estimate**: Predicts a single value (e.g., tomorrow’s temperature).
- **Probability Estimate**: Predicts a distribution of values.
- **Generative Models**: Generate data similar to the training data.

### **7. Performance Metrics**

- **Metrics Used**:
    - **Mean-Square Error (MSE)**: For regression tasks.
    - **Error Rate**: For classification tasks.
    - **Log Likelihood**: For probabilistic models.

### **8. Training and Validation**

- **Goal**: To build models that perform well on new, unseen data.
- **Process**:
    - Split data into training and test sets.
    - **Overfitting**: Model performs well on training data but poorly on test data.
    - **Good Generalization**: Model performs well on both training and test sets.

### **9. Model Learning**

- **Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM)**: A common method where models minimize a loss function based on training data to improve accuracy.

### **10. Example Applications**

- **Disease Diagnosis**:
    - Predict if a patient has a disease based on symptoms (binary classification).
- **Digit Recognition**:
    - Classify handwritten digits from images (e.g., MNIST dataset).

### **11. Datasets and Software**

- **Popular Datasets**:
    - Kaggle, ImageNet (14 million images), Street View House Numbers, Waymo (self-driving car data).
- **Popular ML Libraries**:
    - **Deep Learning**: PyTorch, Keras, TensorFlow.
    - **Traditional ML**: Scikit-Learn, Spark/Mllib.
