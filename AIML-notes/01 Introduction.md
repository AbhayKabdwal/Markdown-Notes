#### **Artificial Intelligence (AI) Overview**

- **Evolution**: AI has gained immense attention due to advancements in big data and computing power. Itâ€™s seen as transformative in nearly every industry.
- **Definitions**:
    - AI refers to creating systems that perform tasks that would require intelligence if performed by humans. #tech_definitions
    - **Key AI Approaches**:
        - Systems that think/act like humans.
        - Systems that think/act rationally.
    - **The law of Thought approach** - These law of thought approach were supposed to govern the operation of mind; their study initiated the field called logic.
    - **The Rational Agent approach** - is one that acts so as to achieve the best outcome or, when there is uncertainty, the best expected outcome
